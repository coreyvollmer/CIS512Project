# Project Description From Rubric

Introduction -- 
The objective of this project is to provide students with an end-to-end walk-through of the Data Analytics pathway. You will be responsible for managing a $10 million investment for one of the states in the United States, and must figure out the best way to invest that money including, industry, region, and distribution method. You will then provide a report of your approach and recommendations to the class, along with a brief presentation. Finally, you will validate another student’s approach to the problem and recommended solution.

Project Summary -- 
The goal of the project is to develop a spending/investment plan for encouraging economic development in a specific state. You will be given a budget of $10 million dollars and tasked with identifying the best way to spend the money to help generate a resurgence in an industry that is valuable to the state. You will be responsible for understanding something about a key industry for that state, and will use information about the local and national population to help accelerate economic development.
